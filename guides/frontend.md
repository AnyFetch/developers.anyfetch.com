Creating a frontend ranges from very easy to incredibly hard, depending on what you want to achieve.

You'll need to read the documentation for [all endpoints](/anyfetch-doc/endpoints), especially the `/documents/` one.

The API sends CORS header, so you can use a single page application -- no need for a server to communicate with the API.

The [default frontend for anyFetch](https://github.com/Papiel/anyfetch.com) is opensourced, and can be used for inspiration.
