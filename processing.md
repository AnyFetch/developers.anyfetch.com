# Processing documents

After globally registering your reader with the manifest, Users will be able to install your reader in their enterprise account.

After that you'll receive documents to process.

## Document processing considerations

### API calls limits

Readers API is not concerned by a limited number of API calls.

### Processing time

Papiel allows your reader to take a certain time to process documents. Once this time expires, your reader will be skipped with every reader relying on you. 

For now, you should be able to process a document in less than 10 minutes.
